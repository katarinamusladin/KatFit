## KatFit

## Overview

KatFit is a personalized workout planner designed to help me efficiently track and stick to a structured 5-day workout routine. The app provides a pre-set plan with each day dedicated to specific focus areasâ€”legs, core, upper body, and more.  By providing clear structure of workouts, I can focus on achieving my fitness targets without losing track of my planned excercises. 

### Problem Space

Some times I find myself forgetting what excercises I planned for the day, the number of reps or weights I used in previous workouts. Without clear record, it can be challenging to track progress and stay focused on fitness goals. KatFit will help me stay organized and mantain focus.  

### User Profile

KatFit is primarily designed for my personal use. As the sole user, I will utilize the app to stay consistent to my fitness goals. Also, I will be able to review my past workouts to track progress and make adjustments as needed.
